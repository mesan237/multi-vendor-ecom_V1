issues with images
On ne doit pas inserer le meme nom de categorie

When the vendor is inactive we must hide some informations in the dashboard
display an alert to allow the vendor to notice his account status
I feel like the category must be linked to the attribute
do not forget to to add the test
add attribute slug

How should we handle the deletion whenever there's a link between
two tables ? that means it must be notified that the link is broken

you must provide existing features or a new one
